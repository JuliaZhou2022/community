## Topic
### 1. Review for Checode entering the Board of OSS Compass:
- Yehui Wang introduced the contributions of Checode's deputy general manager Wenxuan Long to the OSS Compass community.
- All board members in attendance unanimously agreed that Checode should become a platinum member of the OSS Compass community.
- Wenxuan Long, as a representative of Checode, enters the OSS Compass community's Board of Directors to participate in community management.
### 2. Wenxuan Long, representing Checode, spoke at the meeting:
- Wenxuan Long introduced Checode Company and its work on software classification in the OSS Compass community.
### 3. Progress of OSS Compass Community Work and the introduction of Compass Lab:
- Yehui Wang introduced the contributions of platinum members such as Nanjing University, Peking University, Open Source China, Huawei, Baidu, and Zhongyi Tan to the community.
- Yehui Wang introduced the new SaaS service of Compass - Compass Lab.
### 4. Community Value Discussion:
- Wang Yehui stated that currently OSS Compass needs to reach consensus from international, domestic, industry and academic levels. The next step is to build international consensus from the CHAOSS community and global open source events such as the Open Source Summit Europe 2023. Currently, academic consensus is mainly supported by professors like Liang Wang from Nanjing University and Professor Minghui Zhou from Peking University. Professor Wang specifically thanked OSS Compass in an article published in the international academic journal CCF-A.
- The boards discussed how to reach consensus with the community and projects, OPSPs, code hosting platforms, universities and research institutions, foundations, government organizations, investment institutions, and individuals:
  - Kun Gao: We need to give Compass a slogan.
  - Zhihao Shan: Achieving consensus should start with clarifying Compass's value proposition.
  - Minghui Zhou: We need to figure out what Compass can do and what value it can bring to others.
  - Yehui Wang: The biggest value of Compass is in selecting excellent open source communities and projects.
  - Minghui Zhou: How do we define excellent communities, and how do we quantify the definition?
  - Hongshu: Use metrics models, and different scenarios have different standards.
  - Kun Gao: We are establishing a system of metrics, not specific values, the values of the metrics are defined by the users.
  - Liang Wang: Different scenarios require different metrics.
  - Minghui Zhou: So we need to build a system.
  - Yehui Wang: Different targets, different needs. We need to focus on specific areas.
  - Zhihao Shan: We need to understand the needs of the open source community, and do research.
  - Yehui Wang: Some of our board members are leaders in the open source community, representing the voice of the open source community, and I hope you can help Compass collect needs and improvement suggestions.
  - Wenxuan Long: The community's vision needs to be supplemented with information about knowing the open source community health through Compass evaluation system.
  - Kun Gao: Compass can be used in the software selection process. The main audience of the open source community is producers and consumers, and different audiences have different needs, needing different measurement models.
  - Yehui Wang: OSPOs should be more concerned with open source softwares selection.
  - Junsong Zhou: Recently, I've been helping the OpenAtom Foundation to set software assessment standards, such as how to use open source, how to choose software, etc. It's closely related to the construction of the open source community. And I'm referring to Compass's evaluation metrics and making some optimizing work for the metrics.
  - Minghui Zhou: Software selection is a good scenario. I've done research in this area before, and I've collaborated with openEuler, recommending software packages based on metrics. I'll send the paper to everyone later.
  - Liang Wang emphasized the importance of software selection and shared his published paper, which is based on information theory and entropy, modeling the evolution of open source community population evolution behaviors from the perspectives of people and software products. The paper concludes with special thanks to Compass.
  - Minghui Zhou: Compass has considerations for industrial applications, and Professor Wang's research can be applied in Compass.
### 5. Compass Lab Demonstration and Discussion
- Yehui Wang introduced and demonstrated how to use Compass Lab, and mentioned that the role of Compass Lab is to provide data and models, allowing users to explore within a defined scope. If users find that the data and metrics are insufficient or unreasonable, they can contact the community to add or customize them.
- Minghui Zhou: Whether it is necessary to calculate all metrics through a single algorithm needs to be considered.
- Yehui Wang: The algorithm originally comes from CHAOSS, and they have explained the use cases very clearly.
- Minghui Zhou: We need to understand what Compass Lab can do for us.
- Yehui Wang: Compass Lab can provide resources like data sets for academic research through APIs.
- Minghui Zhou: It is needed to review existing community evaluation algorithm research results, create an index document collection, and try to implement the results in Compass Lab.
- Code Hosting Platform Implementation: Replacement of the Gitee Index - Whether to replace it directly or make Compass evaluation system coexisting with the original Star count method needs further discussion.
- Hongshu: We need to create a list of popular open source projects in each field to meet business demands.
### 6. Ran Zhou presented the operational plans of Compass community and hoped that the board could provide resources and support for external cooperation and promotion of Compass.
- The boards suggested first clarifying what needs to be done, and then inviting Open Source China and Tencent to cooperate in external outreach.
## Outstanding Issues
1. It is necessary to reorganize the value proposition of OSS Compass, and explore business directions that are more valuable to community members based on the open source community evaluation services.
   - **AP: Yehui Wang organizes board members to discuss and draft new vision, mission, slogans, etc.**
2. Consensus was reached in the discussion: starting with software selection, utilizing the research results of Professor Minghui Zhou and Professor Liang Wang, as well as the existing models of Compass, the community members discuss how to implement these results in engineering of Compass.
   - **AP: Professor Minghui Zhou shares relevant research results with the Compass community, and Yehui Wang organizes developers to implement them.**
4. **AP: Yehui Wang organizes relevant community members to review existing research results of community evaluation algorithm, create an index document collection, and try to implement them in Compass Lab.**
5. **AP: Yehui Wang organizes relevant boards to discuss the Gitee index replacement plan.**
6. **AP: Ran Zhou should clarify the specific operational plans ASAP and then invite Hongshu, Zhihao Shan, and others relevant to participate in the discussion.**
