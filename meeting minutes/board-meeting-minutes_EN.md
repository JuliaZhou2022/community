2. SaaS service updates:
   - Launch of Project Deep Dive Insight Solution, providing detailed information on contributors, issues, pull requests (PRs), etc.
   - Launch of Compass Collaboration:
     - Nanjing University - open source project activity prediction model;
     - Peking University - GFI-Bot, an intelligent recommendation tool for novice tasks;
     - Peking University - MigrationAdvisor, an intelligent library migration recommendation tool;
     - Peking University - LicenseRec, a license recommendation tool for open source software;
     - openEuler - Document companion bug-catching tool.
3. Homepage of the official website has updates of the three-dimensional evaluation system diagram, calendar, blog, etc., and comprehensive update of the documentation page is ongoing.
4. Compass is replacing Gitee Index:
   - Expected to complete all the replacement at the end of January, 2024, allowing Gitee Index and Compass evaluation solution to coexist on the Gitee platform until then.
### Feedback and Discussion on the Above Feature Updates from Board Members
1. Three-dimensional space of the evaluation system:
   - Further discussing and confirmation of the use of the term "collaboration" are needed.
   - Clear explanation needed for the reasons for the crossing of "Productivity, Robustness, Niche Creation", "Software, Collaboration, People" and the models.
   - The comparison between PyTorch and TensorFlow communities regarding Collaboration Development Index, Organizations Activity, and Community Activity models models is useful to demonstrate the community development cycle and provide guidance for achieving development goals. However, the representativeness of the comparison needs further verification, and it would be ideal to identify common phenomena and explain the underlying principles to have universal guidance for community development.
   - Privacy authorization issues need to be addressed for the data collection of the three contributor persona models. Confirmation is required on whether Compass can publicly disclose contributor information, and the intended audience for this information should be discussed. The user authorization agreement for data sources needs to be reviewed to determine specific provisions for data usage compliance.
2. Project Deep Dive Insight Solution:
   - Detailed contributor, issue, and PR information is beneficial for project managers.
   - Changes in trends should be visible through comparative analysis.
   - Board members should have access to the data.
   - The contributor distribution pie chart should directly display the total number of contributors for better visualization.
3. Compass Collaboration:
   - A platform displaying collaborative achievements, showcasing best practices from industry, academia and research communities.
   - Recommending excellent academic achievements and industrial practices to the open source community.
   - Difference between Compass Collaboration and Compass Lab: Lab is a model experiment laboratory with less usage than imagined.
4. Compass replacing Gitee Index:
   - Gradual acceptance without extensive promotion.
   - No ranking, providing necessary information for open source communities only.
### Proposal from Nanjing University
Professors Xianping Tao and Liang Wang from Nanjing University proposed a discussion on "how to achieve an open source project measurement-feedback-improvement cycle based on the OSS Compass evaluation metric system". The proposal was discussed among the board members, leading to some conclusions:
   - Some open source projects from Baidu have voluntarily used OSS Compass evaluation services, indicating its value to the open source community.
   - Baidu, Huawei, and Startogether.ai Community can select some of their own open source projects and use OSS Compass for measurement and improvement, compiling these cases and making them public to attract more communities to participate in this cycle.
### Discussion on Collaboration between OSS Compass and Industry, Academia and Research Communities
1. Collaboration with training institutions to promote the use of OSS Compass open source evaluation solutions, spread the OSS Compass brand, and establish factual standards for open source evaluation.
2. In 2024, OSS Compass will collaborate deeply with CHAOSS to jointly create international standards for open source evaluation.
3. Data usage in academic collaborations:
    - Basic data usage requirements can be lenient.
    - Core value data needs to be obtained through contributions or project collaboration.
    - Overseas data access permissions need legal confirmation.
4. OSS Compass provides information only, and interpretation of the information requires cooperation with business consulting companies. Discussions can be held with organizations such as A16Z and OSS Capital to produce industry insight reports.
5. Business consulting cooperation can be conducted through OSChina, but specific details need further discussion.
6. OSS Compass needs to remain neutral and cater to different groups' needs at different levels, providing forward-looking solutions, and offering specific solutions for different user groups as well.
### Presentation and Discussion on the OSS Compass LLMs Evaluation Collaboration Platform
OSS Compass has been developing the LLMs evaluation collaboration platform, and Yehui Wang presented the prototype of the platform.
1. The platform focuses on addressing two pain points in the large language model industry: model selection and model verification, aiming to build or maintain datasets in vertical fields.
2. The platform does not rank models but provides evaluation datasets for model developers and selectors in vertical domains.
3. Board members suggested further consideration and validation of the true value and industry demand match of this LLMs evaluation collaboration platform, as well as identifying its differences from similar platforms.
